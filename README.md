This project is will be a collection of data visualizations that show the complicated state of women in the US. The first
visualization is fairly straightforward, I used stitches to represent the approximate number of women who died due to
complications during childbirth in the US in 2015. I felt it was important to portray each woman, as a lot of the discussion
around maternal mortality revolves around numbers like “26.4 deaths per 100,000 live births”, which is helpful when comparing
our rate to that of other countries (a woman is 3 times as likely to die during childbirth in the US than any other
industrialized nation), but masks the lives behind that number.

The project is named for Odysseus’ wife in *The Odyssey*, who waits for his return weaving and unweaving Laertes’ burial shroud,saying that when it is finished she will marry one of her suitors. Her character, while somewhat complex, 
sets the tone for the portrayal of women in the monomyth (the hero’s journey) as anything but the hero. 

In finishing the textiles I weave, I am simultaneously working within a sort of traditionally gendered 
activity while also pushing back against the patriarchy, something I find rather thought provoking as we 
examine what it means to be a successful woman in our society.  I consider the prospect that as a woman, 
I don’t need to fill a mold created by men before me in order to be successful, and if I should
choose to carry myself or act in such a way that is traditionally feminine, that has value too.

## project goals

Eventually, I'd like to implement a lightweight API that allows for the generation of weaving patterns based on data,
dimensions, and yarn weight, but that will have to wait a little while until things slow down a bit :)
