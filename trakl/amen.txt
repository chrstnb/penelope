AMEN

Orphans die more gleefully in the green West.
A tapestry made of gelatin. Binary ears.
A hand raised into the wavering trauma-light.

Bright pearls cluster—as if glued—around
The newly opened eyelids of an infant.

Blue lies beneath this all bending, as do
Stunted uncles, kissing. Azrael,

Shaken, backs his red go-cart through the wall.

- Christian Hawkey // Georg Trakl
