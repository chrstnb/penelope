			<h2>Data</h2>
			<p>Initially, I wanted to use data showing problems in the entertainment industry, especially in the context of the presentation of women and their roles in epic stories, however my mind kept returning to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/05/12/527806002/focus-on-infants-during-childbirth-leaves-u-s-moms-in-danger" target="_blank">something I'd read in NPR</a> and the slew of things it made me think about (more on that below).</p>
			<p>When trying to sort through exactly what the data would look like, I felt compelled to find data that would be simple enough to visualize given a certian degree of uncertainty in terms of how much room I'd have to work with and what the meaning would be. As I looked at <a href="http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(16)31470-2.pdf" target="_blank">the data on maternal mortality</a>, I was intrigued to consider the way that NPR had presented the data, in a chart highlihgting that with 26.4 deaths per 100,000 live births, the US had amost three times as many deaths as any other "developed" country (more thoughts on this later as well). I did the math to see if it might be an interesting percentage to visualize, and realized that visualizing .0264% was probably not my best option, and could in fact make the data seem positive.</p>
			<p>Although I understood that the way they prsented the data (which, I should mention, fell alongside a very human story about the impact of the numbers), the reduction implied that there wasn't value to the fact that approxomately 1,063 women died of complications from childbirth in 2015. Although those numbers aren't nearly as staggering as some, thinking about the stories behind the data felt evocative.</p>

			<h2>Weaving</h2>
			<p>I chose to use each yellow stitch to represent one death, and though I considered aggregating these in a color-block fashion, this could be a little confusing as the gray yarn doesn't represent anything at all. Instead, I created a pattern of sorts: random highs and lows that might resemble a heart rate.</p>
